                    A cluster of provinces in and around Beijing in the eastern-central part of China have large Gini index values and (though it is difficult to see in the image below) some of the highest GDP per capita values. It is likely that urbanization during this time period promoted economic growth and population migration to the nationâ€™s capital. I was surprised to see that some areas on the southeastern coast of China did not have more significant Gini values. Many of them have high GDP per capita values, but not the same soaring Gini values of the Beijing area. I suspect this is because there are more mutual flows between provinces in the southeast than there are in the northeast. In the northeast, the majorities of the flows are to the Beijing area without much going out. Qinghai and Ningxia provinces also have high Gini values, but since all arrows go out of these provinces we can assume that these are provinces that are disproportionately giving migration flow. Looking at the flow arrows, it seems these provinces lost people to urbanization in nearby provinces, likely with more work and resources available. One standout on the lower end of GDP per capita and Gini is Inner Mongolia in the northwest which has a middling GDP per capita and seems to have had roughly equal outflow and inflow.
