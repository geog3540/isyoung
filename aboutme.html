    <p>In my geography coursework, I have obtained many relevant skills like data management, using Microsoft Office and GIS softwares, and flexible scientific thinking. 
    Supplemental coursework in philosophy and creative writing have provided me with excellent written and verbal communication skills. 
    Beyond the classroom, I have worked with Dr. Susan Meerdink in the University of Iowa’s LOQATE as an undergraduate researcher. 
    In this position, I have become familiar with fascinating research projects, the equipment necessary to conduct them, and have developed relationships with many members of SEES. 
    For this research, I was awarded the Independent Creative Research by Undergraduates Fellowship and am featured in the University of Iowa’s Dare to Discover research campaign. 
    I presented my work to state representatives and community members at Research in the Capitol this spring.</p>
    <p>Working at my local community center, I have gained valuable interpersonal skills and learned to navigate the needs of many stakeholders. 
    I have also worked with administrative software to manage programming, event scheduling, and individual member profiles.
